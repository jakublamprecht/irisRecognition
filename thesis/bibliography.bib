    abstract = {The relative efficiency of any particular image-coding scheme should be defined only in relation to the class of images that the code is likely to encounter. To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy.},

abstract="The work deals with the iris pattern recognition as one of the most popular automated biometric ways of individual identification. It is based on the acquired eye images in which we localize the region of interest -- the iris. This extremely data-rich biometric identifier is stable throughout human life and well protected as internal part of the eye. Moreover, it is genetic independent, so that we can use it to identify or verify people among huge population. This chapter will present the human vision nature focusing on defects and diseases that change the surface information of the iris. Also will be shown the main stream and the historical background of mathematical research resulting in a new algorithm for automatic iris feature extraction. A special attention is paid to the method developed to detect the iris rotation for accurate success rate under different destructive problems and environmental conditions. The obtained results after using the new mathematical model have proved the algorithm high success rate in iris pattern recognition.",
